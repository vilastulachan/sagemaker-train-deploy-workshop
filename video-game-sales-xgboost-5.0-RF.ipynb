    "Word of mouth in the form of user reviews, critic reviews, social media comments, etc. often can provide insights about whether a product ultimately will be a success. In the video game industry in particular, reviews and ratings can have a large impact on a game's success. However, not all games with bad reviews fail, and not all games with good reviews turn out to be hits. To predict hit games, machine learning algorithms potentially can take advantage of various relevant data attributes in addition to reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will work with the data set Video Game Sales with Ratings. This [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available) data includes attributes for user reviews as well as critic reviews, sales, ESRB ratings, among others. Both user reviews and critic reviews are in the form of ratings scores, on a scale of 0 to 10 or 0 to 100. Although this is convenient, a significant issue with the data set is that it is relatively small.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with a small data set such as this one is a common problem in machine learning. This problem often is compounded by imbalances between the classes in the small data set. In such situations, using an ensemble learner can be a good choice.  This notebook will focus on using XGBoost, a popular ensemble learner, to build a classifier to determine whether a game will be a hit. \n",

    "Of the all games in the test set that actually are \"hits\" by our metric, the model correctly identified 74, while the overall error rate is 13%.  The amount of false negatives versus true positives can be shifted substantially in favor of true positives by increasing the hyperparameter scale_pos_weight. Of course, this increase comes at the expense of reduced accuracy/increased error rate and more false positives. How to make this trade-off ultimately is a business decision based on the relative costs of false positives, false negatives, etc."
